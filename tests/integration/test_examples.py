    When running a Jupyter notebook, the cwd is set to the notebook's dir. The
    examples.ipynb notebook relies on relative paths to files in the repository,
    due to it being difficult to consistently get the location of a notebook
    from within the notebook itself, so absolute paths can't be used.

    When pytest is used to run the examples.py script (created directly from the
    notebook), the script uses the actual cwd instead, which is (usually) the
    project root dir. Therefore the examples.ipynb notebook and pytest-run
    examples.py script both rely on the cwd being the same, but without
    intervention it is different in each case.

    Hence the test needs to set the cwd to the notebook's dir before running so
    that the examples.py script uses the same cwd as the notebook.
