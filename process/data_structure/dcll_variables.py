Acronyms for this module:

     BB          Breeding Blanket
     FW          First Wall
     BZ          Breeder Zone
     MF/BSS      Manifold/Back Supporting Structure
     LT          Low Temperature
     HT          High Temperature
     MMS         Multi Module Segment
     SMS         Single Module Segment
     IB          Inboard
     OB          Outboard
     HCD         Heating & Current Drive
     FCI         Flow Channel Insert

IN.DAT info for DCLL:

     Select DCLL model
         i_blanket_type = 5 * DCLL

     Liquid Metal Breeder Material = PbLi
         i_blkt_liquid_breeder_type = 0 * Liquid Metal Breeder Material = PbLi

     Specify dual-coolant i.e., get mass flow required from heat extracted from liquid metal breeder
         i_blkt_dual_coolant = 2

     FIC switch: 0 = no FIC, Eurofer; 1 = FCIs, perfect electrical insulator, 2 = FCIs, with specified conductance
         i_blkt_liquid_breeder_channel_type = 0, 1, or 2

     Liquid metal duct wall conductance initialized at Eurofer value in fwbs_variables, or can input other value, used for i_blkt_liquid_breeder_channel_type = 0 or 2
         (bz_channel_conduct_liq)

     Choose if FW and BB structure are on the same pumping system (unless have different coolants), default is same coolant with flow IN->FW->BB->OUT
         (i_fw_blkt_shared_coolant)

     Can set inlet and outlet temperature for liquid metal breeder
         (inlet_temp_liq)
         (outlet_temp_liq)
