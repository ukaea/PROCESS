        This routine determines the size of the plant buildings.
        The reactor building and maintenance building are sized
        based on the tokamak dimensions. The cryogenic building volume is
        scaled based on the total cryogenic load. The other building
        sizes are input from other modules or by the user.
        This routine was modified to include fudge factors (fac1,2,...)
        to fit the ITER design, September 1990 (J. Galambos).
        This routine was included in PROCESS in January 1992 by
        P. C. Shipe.
