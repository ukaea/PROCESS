# Preprocess PROCESS Fortran sources before they are wrapped
# Author: Timothy Nunn
# Date: 2021-11-09

# Note: CMake verbatim commands insert quotes inappropriately meaning
# the preprocessor directives must (annoyingly) be inserted directly inside
# of the command

# Note: when adding new preprocessor directives, you are responsible
# for adding in appropriate ' marks for non-integer/float variables
# e.g. -Dfoo=some string of text
# will not work and must be -Dfoo="'some string of text'"
# where the "" are for CMake to identify this as a string
# and the '' are then directly inserted into the fortran along
# with the text
