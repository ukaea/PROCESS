# Lower Hybrid Current Drive
Lower hybrid heating is that produced by a lower hybrid wave; a plasma wave of frequency between the ion and electron cyclotron frequencies. It has a component of electric field parallel to the magnetic field, so it can accelerate electrons moving along the field lines.

Lower hybrid resonance heating utilizes electromagnetic power in the frequency range 1-8 GHz. At 3 GHz the vacuum wavelength is 0 1 m thus allowing the energy to be transmitted and launched by means of wave guides operating in their fundamental mode. This is one of the principle advantages of this scheme

The lower hybrid range of frequencies satisfies wa«« wce Propagation in this frequency range is again well described by eqn 5 6 1 where the dielectric tensor elements are approximately
The use of lower hybrid waves was originally proposed with the object of heating the ions. For this purpose it is essential to choose conditions such that the lower hybrid resonance occurs in the plasma The condition for this is, from eqn 5 7 2,
