# Lower Hybrid Current Drive | `LowerHybrid`

Lower hybrid heating is generated through the propagation of a lower hybrid wave within a plasma, characterized by a frequency lying between the ion and electron cyclotron frequencies. This wave possesses an electric field component parallel to the magnetic field, enabling the acceleration of electrons traveling along the field lines.

Lower hybrid resonance heating employs electromagnetic power within the 1-8 GHz frequency range. At 3 GHz, the vacuum wavelength measures 0.1 meters, facilitating the transmission and launching of energy via waveguides operating in their fundamental mode. This feature stands out as a primary advantage of this method.
