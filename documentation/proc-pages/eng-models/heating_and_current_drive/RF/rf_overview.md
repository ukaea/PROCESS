# Radio Frequency Heating


## Lower Hybrid Current Drive
Lower hybrid heating is that produced by a lower hybrid wave; a plasma wave of frequency between the ion and electron cyclotron frequencies. It has a component of electric field parallel to the magnetic field, so it can accelerate electrons moving along the field lines.
