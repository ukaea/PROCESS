# Radio Frequency Heating

In the realm of radiofrequency (RF) heating, electromagnetic energy is introduced into the plasma through radio or microwave frequencies, facilitating a resonant energy transfer from the waves to the plasma. Various RF heating techniques are presently under investigation, including Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH) operating in the gigahertz (microwave) range, Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH) in the megahertz (radiowave) range, and Lower Hybrid Heating (LHH) operating in the vector range between ICRF and ECRH. Consequently, "RF heating" encompasses a diverse set of independent approaches.

Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating has proven effective in ion heating within plasma for an extended period. Both slow and fast wave systems have been developed to heat ions in different plasma confinement devices such as stellarators, tokamaks, and mirrors. This method has demonstrated efficiency at the first and second harmonic, as well as higher ion cyclotron frequencies. Achieving power levels reaching several megawatts has been successful, resulting in ion heating efficiencies comparable to those attained with a neutral beam.

The transmitter functions as a wave generator, producing the required RF signal in terms of power and frequency, sustaining this signal from reactor startup to burn phase. The RF wave is then transmitted through a coaxial cable or other suitable transmission line to the tuning network, which optimizes the system impedance for efficient power delivery to the plasma. The actual delivery is executed by an antenna situated in the plasma chamber. This antenna incorporates a radiating element, often a loop, covered by a Faraday shield. The design of the Faraday shield poses a significant challenge, requiring consideration of polarization requirements, heat loads from the plasma, erosion caused by plasma particles, and induced RF currents.

Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH) employs microwave energy within the gigahertz frequency range, generated by a device called a "gyrotron." In this process, a high-power electron beam traverses a potent magnetic field created by superconducting magnets. The electron beam follows a spiral trajectory in the magnetic field, emitting microwave radiation. These microwaves are conveyed to the plasma chamber through waveguides, passing through a dielectric window—crafted from materials like ceramic or diamond—before being directed into the plasma where absorption occurs. Successfully implemented ECRH systems, featuring multiple 1-gigawatt gyrotrons, waveguides, and diamond windows, have been developed for deployment on DIII-D.

The Lower Hybrid Heating (LHH) system shares similarities with ECRH and ICRH systems, utilizing analogous equipment such as transmitters, transmission lines, and wave launchers or antennas. However, the key distinction lies in the positioning and design of the launcher. Due to the higher frequency of waves used in ECRH and LHH, a waveguide can replace a loop antenna and Faraday shield. This waveguide facilitates strategic placement of critical components, including ceramic windows, within the reactor's shield, thereby mitigating radiation damage to these essential elements.

In plasma conditions where the plasma frequency surpasses the microwave frequency, preventing microwaves from penetrating into the core plasma where electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) occurs, an alternative is sought. In such instances, the electron Bernstein wave (EBW) is employed, given its electrostatic nature, allowing it to propagate without encountering density limitations. The EBW originates through mode conversion from the slow X-mode at the upper hybrid resonance (UHR) and exhibits resonances at harmonics of the EC frequency [10, 11].

In tokamak plasmas, where the magnetic field varies inversely with the major radius, spatial areas for EBW propagation are distinctively arranged in a band structure between two adjacent harmonic ECRs. When microwaves are injected from the outboard side and EBW is triggered at the UHR layer through the OXB mode-conversion scheme, the EBW is confined to propagate solely between the UHR layer and the harmonic ECR layer on the inboard side.
