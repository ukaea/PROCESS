\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

By default, the plasma is assumed to have an up-down asymmetric, single
null configuration (although this can be changed with user inputs). A
great number of physics models are coded within PROCESS to describe the
behaviour of the plasma parameters such as its current, temperature,
density, pressure, confinement etc., and also the various limits that
define the stable operating domain.

\subsection{Plasma Geometry}\label{plasma-geometry}

The plasma (geometric) major radius \(R_0\) (\texttt{rmajor}) and aspect
ratio \(A\) (\texttt{aspect}) define the size of the plasma torus. The
plasma minor radius \(a\) (\texttt{rminor}) is calculated from these
values. The shape of the plasma cross-section is given by its last
closed flux surface (LCFS) elongation \(\kappa\) (\texttt{kappa}) and
triangularity \(\delta\) (\texttt{triang}), which can be scaled
automatically with the aspect ratio if required using switch
\texttt{ishape}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{ishape\ =\ 0} -- the input values for \texttt{kappa} and
  \texttt{triang} are used directly.
\item
  \texttt{ishape\ =\ 1} -- the following scaling is used, which is
  suitable for low aspect ratio machines (\(\epsilon = 1/A\)) \footnote{J.D.
    Galambos, `STAR Code : Spherical Tokamak Analysis and Reactor Code',
    Unpublished internal Oak Ridge document.}:
\end{itemize}

\[\begin{aligned}
\kappa & = 2.05 (1 + 0.44 \epsilon^{2.1}) \\
\delta & = 0.53 (1 + 0.77 \epsilon^3)
\end{aligned}\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{ishape\ =\ 2} -- the Zohm ITER scaling \footnote{H. Zohm et
    al, `On the Physics Guidelines for a Tokamak DEMO', FTP/3-3, Proc.
    IAEA Fusion Energy Conference, October 2012, San Diego} is used to
  calculate the elongation: \[
    \kappa = F_{kz} \, \times \, \mathrm{minimum} \left( 2.0, \, \, 1.5 + \frac{0.5}{A-1} \right)
    \] where input variable \texttt{fkzohm} \(= F_{kz}\) may be used to
  adjust the scaling, while the input value of the triangularity is used
  unchanged.
\end{itemize}

If \texttt{ishape\ =\ 0,\ 1,\ 2}, the values for the plasma shaping
parameters at the 95\% flux surface are calculated as follows:

\[\begin{aligned}
\kappa_{95} & = \kappa / 1.12 \\
\delta_{95} & = \delta / 1.5
\end{aligned}\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If \texttt{ishape\ =\ 3}, the Zohm ITER scaling is used to calculate
  the elongation (as for \texttt{ishape\ =\ 2} above), but the
  triangularity at the 95\% flux surface is input via variable
  \texttt{triang95}, and the LCFS triangularity \texttt{triang} is
  calculated from it, rather than the other way round.
\item
  Finally, if \texttt{ishape\ =\ 4}, the 95\% flux surface values
  \texttt{kappa95} and \texttt{triang95} are both used as inputs, and
  the LCFS values are calculated from them by inverting the equations
  above.
\end{itemize}

A constraint relating to the plasma's vertical stability may be turned
on if required. In principle, the inner surface of the outboard shield
could be used as the location of a conducting shell which should
mitigate the vertical displacement growth rate of plasmas with
significant elongation \footnote{Y. Sakamoto, `Recent progress in
  vertical stability analysis in JA', Task meeting EU-JA \#16, Fusion
  for Energy, Garching, 24--25 June 2014}. The maximum distance
\(r_{\text{shell, max}}\) of this shell from the centre of the plasma
may be set using input parameter \texttt{cwrmax}, such that
\(r_{\text{shell, max}} =\) \texttt{cwrmax*rminor}. Constraint equation
no. 23 should be turned on with iteration variable no.~104
(\texttt{fcwr}) to enforce this. (A scaling of \texttt{cwrmax} with
elongation should be available shortly.)

The plasma surface area, cross-sectional area and volume are calculated
using formulations that approximate the LCFS as a revolution of two arcs
which intersect the plasma X-points and the plasma midplane outer and
inner radii. (This is a reasonable assumption for double-null diverted
plasmas, but will be inaccurate for single-null plasmas,
\texttt{snull\ =\ 1}.) Switch \texttt{igeom} determines whether an old
method is used (\texttt{igeom\ =\ 0}) or whether calculations based on a
more recent derivation (\texttt{igeom\ =\ 1}).

\subsection{Fusion Reactions}\label{fusion-reactions}

The most likely fusion reaction to be utilised in a power plant is the
deuterium-tritium reaction:

\[
\mathrm{D + T} \Longrightarrow \mathrm{^{4}He + n + 17.6 \,MeV}
\]

20\% of the energy produced is given to the alpha particles (\(^4\)He),
a fraction of which remain (c.f. \texttt{falpha}) within the plasma and
thermalise (slow down) due to collisions, thus heating the plasma. The
remaining 80\% is carried away by the neutrons, which deposit their
energy within the blanket and shield.

PROCESS can also model D-\(^3\)He power plants, which utilise the
following primary fusion reaction:

\[
\mathrm{D + \text{$^3$He}} \Longrightarrow \mathrm{^{4}He + p + 18.3 \,MeV}
\]

The fusion reaction rate is significantly different to that for D-T
fusion, and the power flow from the plasma is modified since charged
particles are produced rather than neutrons. Because only charged
particles (which remain in the plasma) are produced by this reaction,
the whole of the fusion power is used to heat the plasma. Useful energy
is extracted from the plasma since the radiation power produced is very
high, and this can be converted to electricity in a number of ways.

Since the temperature required to ignite the D-\(^3\)He reaction is
considerably higher than that for D-T, it is necessary to take into
account the following D-D reactions, which have significant reaction
rates at such temperatures:

\[\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{D + D}  & \Longrightarrow \mathrm{^{3}He + n + 3.27 \,MeV} \\
\mathrm{D + D}  & \Longrightarrow \mathrm{T + p + 4.03 \,MeV}
\end{aligned}\]

Also, as tritium is produced by the latter reaction, D-T fusion is also
possible. As a result, there is still a small amount of neutron power
extracted from the plasma.

Pure D-\(^3\)He tokamak power plants do not include blankets, because of
the near absence of neutrons leaving the plasma, and the fact that no
tritium needs to be produced for fuel.

The contributions from all four of the above fusion reactions are
included in the total fusion power production calculation. The fusion
reaction rates are calculated using the parameterizations in \footnote{H.S.
  Bosch and G.M. Hale, `Improved Formulas for Fusion Cross-sections and
  Thermal Reactivities', Nuclear Fusion \textbf{32} (1992) 611},
integrated over the plasma profiles (correctly, with or without
pedestals).

The fractional composition of the `fuel' ions (D, T and \(^3\)He) is
controlled using the three variables \texttt{fdeut}, \texttt{ftrit} and
\texttt{fhe3}, respectively:

\[\begin{aligned}
n_{\mbox{fuel}}  & = n_D + n_T + n_{\mathrm{^{3}He}}  \;\;\; \mbox{particles/m$^3$} \\
n_D  & = \mathtt{fdeut} \, n_{\mbox{fuel}} \\
n_T  & = \mathtt{ftrit} \, n_{\mbox{fuel}} \\
n_{\mathrm{^{3}He}} & = \mathtt{fhe3} \, n_{\mbox{fuel}}
\end{aligned}\]

PROCESS checks that \(fdeut + ftrit + fhe3 = 1.0\), and stops with an
error message otherwise.

\subsection{Plasma Profiles}\label{plasma-profiles}

If switch \texttt{ipedestal\ =\ 0}, the plasma profiles are assumed to
be parabolic, i.e.they are of the form

\[\begin{aligned}
\mbox{Density : } n(\rho) & = n_0 \left( 1 - \rho^2 \right)^{\alpha_n} \\
\mbox{Temperature : } T(\rho) & = T_0 \left( 1 - \rho^2 \right)^{\alpha_T} \\
\mbox{Current : } J(r) & = J_0 \left( 1 - \rho^2 \right)^{\alpha_J}
\end{aligned}\]

where \(\rho = r/a\), and \(a\) is the plasma minor radius. This gives
volume-averaged values \(\langle n \rangle = n_0 / (1+\alpha_n)\), and
line-averaged values \(\bar{n} \sim n_0 / \sqrt{(1+\alpha_n)}\), etc.
These volume- and line-averages are used throughout the code along with
the profile indices \(\alpha\), in the various physics models, many of
which are fits to theory-based or empirical scalings. Thus, the plasma
model in PROCESS may be described as 1/2-D. The relevant profile index
variables are \texttt{alphan}, \texttt{alphat} and \texttt{alphaj},
respectively.

However, by default, \texttt{ipedestal\ =\ 1} which allows the density
and temperature profiles to include a pedestal, using the forms
specified in \footnote{J. Johner, `Helios: A Zero-Dimensional Tool for
  Next Step and Reactor Studies', Fusion Science and Technology
  \textbf{59} (2011) 308--349}:

\[\begin{aligned}
\mbox{density:} \qquad n(\rho) = \left\{
\begin{aligned}
    & n_{ped} + (n_0 - n_{ped}) \left( 1 -
    \frac{\rho^2}{\rho_{ped,n}^2}\right)^{\alpha_n}
   & \qquad 0 \leq \rho \leq \rho_{ped,n} \\
   & n_{sep} + (n_{ped} - n_{sep})\left( \frac{1- \rho}{1-\rho_{ped,n}}\right)
   & \qquad \rho_{ped,n} < \rho \leq 1
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{aligned}\]

\[\begin{aligned}
\mbox{temperature:} \qquad T(\rho) = \left\{
\begin{aligned}
   & T_{ped} + (T_0 - T_{ped}) \left( 1 - \frac{\rho^{\beta_T}}
    {\rho_{ped,T}^{\beta_T}}\right)^{\alpha_T}  & \qquad 0 \leq \rho \leq \rho_{ped,T} \\
   & T_{sep} + (T_{ped} - T_{sep})\left( \frac{1- \rho}{1-\rho_{ped,T}}\right)
   & \qquad \rho_{ped,T} < \rho \leq 1
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{aligned}\]

Subscripts \(0\), \(ped\) and \(sep\), denote values at the centre
(\(\rho = 0\)), the pedestal (\(\rho = \rho_{ped}\)) and the separatrix
(\(\rho=1\)), respectively. The density and temperature peaking
parameters \(\alpha_n\) and a \(\alpha_T\) as well as the second
exponent \(\beta_T\) (input parameter \texttt{tbeta}, not to be confused
with the plasma beta) in the temperature profile can be chosen by the
user, as can the pedestal heights and the values at the separatrix
(\texttt{neped,\ nesep} for the electron density, and
\texttt{teped,\ tesep} for the electron temperature; the ion equivalents
are scaled from the electron values by the ratio of the volume-averaged
values).

The density at the centre is given by:

\[\begin{aligned}
  \nonumber
  n_0 & = & \frac{1}{3\rho_{ped,n}^2} \left[3\langle n\rangle (1+\alpha_n)
    + n_{sep} (1+\alpha_n) (-2 + \rho_{ped,n} + \rho_{ped,n}^2) \right.\\
   & & \left. - n_{ped}\left( (1 + \alpha_n)(1+ \rho_{ped,n}) + (\alpha_n -2)
    \rho_{ped,n}^2 \right) \right]
\end{aligned}\]

where \(\langle n \rangle\) is the volume-averaged density. The
temperature at the centre is given by

\[\begin{aligned}
T_0 = T_{ped} + \gamma \left[ T_{ped}\, \rho_{ped,T}^2 - \langle T \rangle +
  \frac{1}{3}(1 - \rho_{ped,T}) \left[ \, (1 + 2\rho_{ped,T}) \, T_{ped} + ( 2 +
    \rho_{ped,T}) \, T_{sep} \, \right] \right]
\end{aligned}\]

with

\[\begin{aligned}
\gamma = \left\{
\begin{aligned}
  & \frac{ -\Gamma(1+\alpha_T+2/\beta_T)}
  {\rho_{ped,T}^2 \, \Gamma(1+\alpha_T) \, \Gamma((2+\beta_T)/\beta_T)}
  \qquad \text{for integer} \, \alpha_T \\
  &\frac{\Gamma(-\alpha_T)\sin(\pi\alpha)\, \Gamma(1+\alpha_T+2/\beta_T)}
  {\pi\rho_{ped,T}^2 \, \Gamma((2+\beta_T)/\beta_T)}
  \qquad \text{for non-integer} \, \alpha_T
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{aligned}\]

where \(\Gamma\) is the gamma function.

Note that density and temperature can have different pedestal positions
\(\rho_{ped,n}\) (\texttt{rhopedn}) and \(\rho_{ped,T}\)
(\texttt{rhopedt}) in agreement with simulations.

The pedestal density can be set directly (if \texttt{iscdens=1}), or as
a fraction of the Greenwald density (if \texttt{iscdens=1}). The default
fraction is 0.8\footnote{M. Bernert et al. Plasma Phys. Control. Fus.
  \textbf{57} (2015) 014038}.

\subsection{Beta Limit}\label{beta-limit}

The plasma beta limit\footnote{N.A. Uckan and ITER Physics Group, `ITER
  Physics Design Guidelines: 1989', ITER Documentation Series, No. 10,
  IAEA/ITER/DS/10 (1990)} is given by

\[\begin{aligned}
\langle \beta \rangle < g \, \frac{I(\mbox{MA})}{a(\mbox{m}) \, B_0(\mbox{T})}
\end{aligned}\]

where \(B_0\) is the axial vacuum toroidal field, and \(\beta\) is
defined with respect to the total equilibrium \(\mathbf{B}\)-field
\footnote{T. C. Hender et al., `Physics Assessment for the European
  Reactor Study', AEA Fusion Report AEA FUS 172 (1992)}. The beta
coefficient \(g\) is set using input parameter \texttt{dnbeta}. To apply
the beta limit, constraint equation no. 24 should be turned on with
iteration variable no. 36 (\texttt{fbetatry}). The limit can be applied
to either the total plasma beta, in which case switch \texttt{iculbl}
should be set to 0, to only the thermal component of the plasma beta, in
which case \texttt{iculbl} should be set to 1, or to the thermal plus
neutral beam components, in which case \texttt{iculbl} should be set to
2.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Aspect ratio scaling of beta \(g\)
coefficient}{Aspect ratio scaling of beta g coefficient}}\label{aspect-ratio-scaling-of-beta-g-coefficient}

Switch \texttt{gtscale} determines whether the beta \(g\) coefficient
\texttt{dnbeta} should scale with aspect ratio
(\(\mathtt{gtscale \not= 0}\)), or be fixed at the input value
(\texttt{gtscale\ =\ 0\}}). Note that \texttt{gtscale} is over-ridden if
\texttt{iprofile} = 1.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Limiting
\(\epsilon.\beta_p\)}{Limiting \textbackslash{}epsilon.\textbackslash{}beta\_p}}\label{limiting-epsilon.beta_p}

To apply a limit to the value of \(\epsilon.\beta_p\), where
\(\epsilon = a/R\) is the inverse aspect ratio, constraint equation no.
6 should be turned on with iteration variable no. 8 (\texttt{fbeta}).
The limiting value of \(\epsilon.\beta_p\) should be set using input
parameter \texttt{epbetmax}.

\subsection{Fast Alpha Pressure
Contribution}\label{fast-alpha-pressure-contribution}

Switch \texttt{ifalphap} may be used to select the model used to
calculate the pressure contribution from the fast alpha particles, there
are two options 1\footnote{N.A. Uckan and ITER Physics Group, `ITER
  Physics Design Guidelines: 1989', ITER Documentation Series, No. 10,
  IAEA/ITER/DS/10 (1990)} and 2\footnote{D.J. Ward, `PROCESS Fast Alpha
  Pressure', Work File Note F/PL/PJK/PROCESS/CODE/050}:

\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{\beta_{\alpha}}{\beta_{th}} & = 0.29 \, \left( \langle T_{10} \rangle -
  0.37 \right) \, \left( \frac{n_{DT}}{n_e} \right)^2
\hspace{20mm} \mbox{ifalphap = 0} \\
\frac{\beta_{\alpha}}{\beta_{th}} & = 0.26 \, \left( \langle T_{10} \rangle -
  0.65 \right)^{0.5} \, \left( \frac{n_{DT}}{n_e} \right)^2
\hspace{16mm} \mbox{ifalphap = 1 (default)}
\end{aligned}\]

The latter model is a better estimate at higher temperatures.

\subsection{Density Limit}\label{density-limit}

Several density limit models\footnote{T. C. Hender et al., `Physics
  Assessment for the European Reactor Study', AEA Fusion Report AEA FUS
  172 (1992)} are available in PROCESS. These are calculated in routine
\texttt{culdlm}, which is called by \texttt{physics}. To enforce any of
these limits, turn on constraint equation no. 5 with iteration variable
no. 9 (\texttt{fdene}). In addition, switch \texttt{idensl} must be set
to the relevant value, as follows:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cl@{}}
\toprule
\texttt{idensl} & Description\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
1 & ASDEX model\tabularnewline
2 & Borrass model for ITER, I\tabularnewline
3 & Borrass model for ITER, II\tabularnewline
4 & JET edge radiation model\tabularnewline
5 & JET simplified model\tabularnewline
6 & Hugill-Murakami \(M.q\) model\tabularnewline
7 & Greenwald model\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Impurities and Radiation}\label{impurities-and-radiation}

The impurity radiation model in PROCESS uses a multi-impurity model
which integrates the radiation contributions over an arbitrary choice of
density and temperature profiles\footnote{H. Lux, R. Kemp, D.J. Ward, M.
  Sertoli, `Impurity radiation in DEMO systems modelling', Fus. Eng.

The impurity number density fractions relative to the electron density
are set using input array \texttt{fimp(1,...,nimp)}, where
\texttt{nimp\ =\ 14} is the number of impurity species in the radiation
model. The available impurities are as follows:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cl@{}}
\toprule
\texttt{fimp} & Species\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
1 & Hydrogen (fraction calculated by code)\tabularnewline
2 & Helium (fraction calculated by code)\tabularnewline
3 & Beryllium\tabularnewline
4 & Carbon\tabularnewline
5 & Nitrogen\tabularnewline
6 & Oxygen\tabularnewline
7 & Neon\tabularnewline
8 & Silicon\tabularnewline
9 & Argon\tabularnewline
10 & Iron\tabularnewline
11 & Nickel\tabularnewline
12 & Krypton\tabularnewline
13 & Xenon\tabularnewline
14 & Tungsten\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

As stated above, the number density fractions for hydrogen (all
isotopes) and helium need not be set, as they are calculated by the code
to ensure that plasma quasi-neutrality is maintained, and taking into
account the fuel ratios \texttt{fdeut}, \texttt{ftrit} and
\texttt{fhe3}, and the alpha particle fraction \texttt{ralpne} which may
be input by the user.

The impurity fraction of one of the elements listed in array
\texttt{fimp} may be used as an iteration variable.

The synchrotron radiation power\footnote{Albajar, Nuclear Fusion
  \textbf{41} (2001) 665} \footnote{Fidone, Giruzzi and Granata, Nuclear
  Fusion \textbf{41} (2001) 1755} is assumed to originate from the
plasma core. The wall reflection factor \texttt{ssync} may be set by the
user.

By changing the input parameter \texttt{coreradius}, the user may set
the normalised radius defining the core region. Only the impurity and
synchrotron radiation from the core region affects the confinement
scaling. Figure 1 below shows the radiation power contributions.

\includegraphics{../img/radiation.png} \emph{Figure 1: Schematic diagram
of the radiation power contributions and how they are split between core
and edge radiation}

Constraint equation no. 17 with iteration variable no. 28
(\texttt{fradpwr}) ensures that the calculated total radiation power
does not exceed the total power available that can be converted to
radiation (i.e.~the sum of the fusion alpha power, other charged
particle fusion power, auxiliary injected power and the ohmic power).
This constraint should always be turned on.

\subsection{Plasma Current Scaling
Laws}\label{plasma-current-scaling-laws}

A number of plasma current scaling laws exploiting the inverse
relationship between plasma current and edge safety factor
\(q_{\psi}\)\footnote{T. C. Hender et al., `Physics Assessment for the
  European Reactor Study', AEA Fusion Report AEA FUS 172 (1992)} are
available in PROCESS. These are calculated in routine \texttt{culcur},
which is called by \texttt{physics}. Flag \texttt{icurr} must be set to
the relevant value, as follows:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cl@{}}
\toprule
\texttt{icurr} & Description\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
1 & Peng analytic fit\tabularnewline
2 & Peng double null divertor scaling (ST)\footnote{J.D. Galambos, `STAR
  Code : Spherical Tokamak Analysis and Reactor Code', Unpublished
  internal Oak Ridge document.}\tabularnewline
3 & Simple ITER scaling\tabularnewline
4 & Revised ITER scaling\footnote{N.A. Uckan, Fusion Technology
  \textbf{14} (1988) 299}\tabularnewline
5 & Todd empirical scaling, I\tabularnewline
6 & Todd empirical scaling, II\tabularnewline
7 & Connor-Hastie model\tabularnewline
8 & Sauter model, allows negative \(\delta\)\tabularnewline
9 & fiesta fit for spherical tokamaks\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Plasma Current Profile
Consistency}\label{plasma-current-profile-consistency}

Self-consistency between the plasma current profile parameters can be enforced
by setting switch \texttt{iprofile} to 1. This ensures that the current
profile peaking factor \texttt{alphaj} is consistent with the input
values for the safety factor on axis and at the plasma edge (\texttt{q0}
and \texttt{q}, respectively), the plasma internal inductance \(l_i\) is
consistent with this \texttt{alphaj}, and the beta \(g\) coefficient
\texttt{dnbeta} scales with \(l_i\).

It is recommended that current scaling law \texttt{icurr\ =\ 4} is used
if \texttt{iprofile\ =\ 1}. Switch \texttt{gtscale} is over-ridden if
\texttt{iprofile\ =\ 1}.

\subsection{Confinement Time Scaling
Laws}\label{confinement-time-scaling-laws}

The particle transport loss power in Watts/m\(^3\) from the plasma is
defined as

\[
P_{\mbox{loss}} = \frac{W}{\tau_E}
\]

where the plasma stored energy per unit volume \(W\) is given by

\[
W = \frac{3}{2} \,n \, e \, T
\]

with particle number density \(n\) in m\(^{-3}\) and particle
temperature \(T\) in eV. PROCESS assumes that the electron and ion
energy confinement times \(\tau_E\) are equal.

Many energy confinement time scaling laws are present within PROCESS,
for tokamaks, RFPs or stellarators. These are calculated in routine
\texttt{pcond}. The value of \texttt{isc} determines which of the
scalings is used in the plasma energy balance calculation. The table
below summarises the available scaling laws. The most commonly used is
the so-called IPB98(y,2) scaling.

\subsubsection{Effect of radiation on energy
confinement}\label{effect-of-radiation-on-energy-confinement}

Published confinement scalings are all based on low radiation pulses. A
power plant will certainly be a high radiation machine --- both in the
core, due to bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation, and in the edge
due to impurity seeding. The scaling data do not predict this radiation
--- that needs to be done by the radiation model. However, if the
transport is very ``stiff'', as predicted by some models, then the
additional radiation causes an almost equal drop in power transported by
ions and electrons, leaving the confinement nearly unchanged.

To allow for these uncertainties, three options are available, using the
switch \texttt{iradloss}. In each case, the particle transport loss
power \(P_{\mbox{loss}}\), referred to in the code as \texttt{pscaling},
is derived directly from the energy confinement scaling law.

\texttt{iradloss\ =\ 0} -- Total power lost is scaling power plus
radiation

\texttt{pscaling\ +\ pradpv\ =\ falpha*palppv\ +\ pchargepv\ +\ pohmpv\ +\ pinjmw/vol}

\texttt{iradloss\ =\ 1} -- Total power lost is scaling power plus core
radiation only

\texttt{pscaling\ +\ pcoreradpv\ =\ falpha*palppv\ +\ pchargepv\ +\ pohmpv\ +\ pinjmw/vol}

\texttt{iradloss\ =\ 2} -- Total power lost is scaling power only, with
no additional allowance for radiation. This is not recommended for power
plant models.

\texttt{pscaling\ =\ falpha*palppv\ +\ pchargepv\ +\ pohmpv\ +\ pinjmw/vol}

\subsection{Plasma Core Power Balance}\label{plasma-core-power-balance}

Figure 2 below shows the flow of power as calculated by the code.

<br>
</center>
\end{verbatim}

The primary sources of power are the fusion reactions themselves, ohmic
power due to resistive heating within the plasma, and any auxiliary
power provided for heating and current drive. The power carried by the
fusion-generated neutrons is lost from the plasma, but is deposited in
the surrounding material. A fraction \texttt{falpha} of the alpha
particle power is assumed to stay within the plasma core to contribute
to the plasma power balance. The sum of this core alpha power, any power
carried by non-alpha charged particles, the ohmic power and any injected
power, is converted into charged particle transport power
(\(P_{\mbox{loss}}\)) plus core radiation power, as shown in Figure 2.
The core power balance calculation is turned on using constraint
equation no. 2 (which should therefore always be used).

\subsection{Bootstrap, Diamagnetic and Pfirsch-Schlüter Current
Scalings}\label{bootstrap-diamagnetic-and-pfirsch-schluxfcter-current-scalings}

The fraction of the plasma current provided by the so-called bootstrap
effect can be either input into the code directly, or calculated using
one of four methods, as summarised here. Note that methods
\texttt{ibss\ =\ 1-3} use fits to parabolic density and temperature
profiles, and do not take into account the existence of pedestals
(\texttt{ipedestal\ =\ 1}), whereas the Sauter et al. scaling
(\texttt{ibss\ =\ 4}) allows general profiles to be used.

!!! Note ``Fixed Bootstrap Current'' Direct input -- To input the
bootstrap current fraction directly, set \texttt{bscfmax} to \((-1)\)
times the required value (e.g. -0.73 sets the bootstrap faction to
0.73).

The diamagnetic current fraction is strongly related to \(\beta\) and is
typically small, hence it is usually neglected. For high \(\beta\)
plasmas, such as those at tight aspect ratio, it should be included and
two scalings are offered. If the diamagnetic current is expected to be
above one per cent of the plasma current, a warning is issued to
calculate it.

\end{longtable}

There is no ability to input the diamagnetic and Pfirsch-Schlüter
current directly. In this case, it is recommended to turn off these two
scalings and to use the method of fixing the bootstrap current fraction.

\subsection{L-H Power Threshold
Scalings}\label{l-h-power-threshold-scalings}

Transitions from a standard confinement mode (L-mode) to an improved
confinement regime (H-mode), called L-H transitions, are observed in
most tokamaks. A range of scaling laws are available that provide
estimates of the auxiliary power required to initiate these transitions,
via extrapolations from present-day devices. PROCESS calculates these
power threshold values for the scaling laws listed in the table below,
in routine \texttt{pthresh}.

To enforce one of these scalings, use input parameter \texttt{ilhthresh}
to select the scaling to use, and turn on constraint equation no. 15
with iteration variable no. 103 (\texttt{flhthresh}). By default, this
will ensure that the power reaching the divertor is at least equal to
the threshold power calculated for the chosen scaling, which is a
necessary condition for H-mode. However, for L-mode it might be
appropriate to set \texttt{boundl(103)\ =\ 0.001,\ boundu(103)\ =\ 1.0},
which will ensure that the power threshold does not exceed the
calculated value, and therefore the machine cannot reach H-mode.

\subsection{Other Plasma Physics
Options}\label{other-plasma-physics-options}

\subsubsection{Neo-Classical Correction
Effects}\label{neo-classical-correction-effects}

Switch \texttt{ires} controls whether neo-classical (trapped particle)
effects are included in the calculation of the plasma resistance and
ohmic heating power in routine \texttt{pohm}, which is called by routine
\texttt{physics}. If \texttt{ires\ =\ 1}, these effects are included.
Note that the scaling used is only valid for aspect ratios between 2.5
and 4, and it is possible for the plasma resistance to be wrongly
calculated as negative if \texttt{ires\ =\ 1} and the aspect ratio is
too high.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Inverse Quadrature in \(\tau_E\) Scaling
Laws}{Inverse Quadrature in \textbackslash{}tau\_E Scaling Laws}}\label{inverse-quadrature-in-tau_e-scaling-laws}

Switch \texttt{iinvqd} determines whether the energy confinement time
scaling laws due to Kaye-Goldston (\texttt{isc\ =\ 5}) and Goldston
(\texttt{isc\ =\ 9}) should include an inverse quadrature scaling with
the Neo-Alcator result (\texttt{isc\ =\ 1}). A value
\texttt{iinvqd\ =\ 1}includes this scaling.

\subsubsection{Plasma / First Wall Gap}\label{plasma-first-wall-gap}

The region directly outside the last closed flux surface of the core
plasma is known as the scrape-off layer, and contains no structural
material. Plasma entering this region is not confined and is removed by
the divertor. PROCESS treats the scrape-off layer merely as a gap.
Switch \texttt{iscrp} determines whether the inboard and outboard gaps
should be calculated as 10\% of the plasma minor radius
(\texttt{iscrp\ =\ 0}), or set equal to the input values
\texttt{scrapli} and \texttt{scraplo} (\texttt{iscrp\ =\ 1}).
