## L-H Power Threshold Scalings

Transitions from a standard confinement mode (L-mode) to an improved
confinement regime (H-mode), called L-H transitions, are observed in most
tokamaks.

A range of scaling laws are available that provide estimates of the
power terms required to initiate these transitions, via extrapolations
from present-day devices. PROCESS calculates these power threshold values
for the scaling laws listed [below](#l-h-scaling-options), in routine `l_h_threshold_power()`.

Depending on the value of the chosen scaling by setting `i_l_h_threshold`, a different L-H threshold power is set to the `p_l_h_threshold_mw` variable.

We define the net power across the seperatrix for the scaling as `p_plasma_separatrix_mw` below. This is equal to the net heating power of the plasma with radiation losses removed. This is then treated as the excess heating power for the plasma that is given to the divertors.

$$
\mathtt{p_plasma_separatrix_mw} = \frac{\mathrm{d}W}{\mathrm{d}t} =  \underbrace{f_{\alpha}P_{\alpha} + P_{\text{c}} + P_{\text{OH}} + P_{\text{HCD}}}_{\text{Plasma heating}} - P_{\text{rad}}
$$

There are two separate constraint equations for enforcing the L-H threshold.

----------------

### Use the full divertor power

This constraint can be activated by stating `icc = 15` in the input file.

The scaling value `fl_h_threshold (ixc=103)` can be varied to set the required margin around the threshold.

$$
1.0 - \mathtt{fl\_h\_threshold} \times \frac{\overbrace{\mathtt{p\_l\_h\_threshold\_mw}}^{\text{Power from scaling}}}{\mathtt{p_plasma_separatrix_mw}}
$$



For an H-mode plasma, `icc = 15` and `fl_h_threshold (ixc=103)` by default will ensure
that the power reaching the divertor is at least equal to the threshold power
calculated for the chosen scaling, which is a necessary condition for
H-mode. 

For an L-mode plasma, `icc = 15` should be turned on but the bounds for `fl_h_threshold (ixc=103)` should be set to `boundl(103) = 0.001` and `boundu(103) = 1.0` to ensure that the power does not exceed the calculated threshold, 
and therefore the machine remains in L-mode.

**Therefore it is recommended to always use `icc = 15` if trying to simulate a plasma scenario specifically in L or H-mode**

-------

### Use the injected power reduced divertor power.

This constraint can be activated by stating `icc = 73` in the input file.

$$
1.0 - \mathtt{fplhsep} \times \frac{\mathtt{p_plasma_separatrix_mw}}{
\underbrace{\mathtt{p\_l\_h\_threshold\_mw}}_{\text{Power from scaling}}+ P_{\text{HCD}}}
$$

The scaling value `fplhsep (ixc=137)` can be varied to set the required margin around the threshold.

## L-H scaling options

### ITER-1996 Scalings

The general form is:

$$
P_{\text{L-H}} = 0.45 (0.6\bar{n}_{e,20}R^2)^{\alpha} \bar{n}^{0.75}_{\text{e},20}B_{\text{T}}R^2
$$

where $\alpha$ lies in the range of $-0.25 \le \alpha \le 0.25$,  $\bar{n}_{\text{e},20}$ is the line-averaged electron density in units of $10^{20} \text{m}^{-3}$, $B_{\text{T}}$ is the toroidal magnetic field in Tesla and $R$ is the plasma major radius in metres.



------------------

#### ITER-1996 Nominal Scaling

Is selected with `i_l_h_threshold = 1` [^1] [^2]

$$
P_{\text{L-H}} = 0.45 \times \bar{n}^{0.75}_{\text{e},20}B_{\text{T}}R^2
$$

---------------

$$
P_{\text{L-H}} = 0.3960502816 \times \bar{n}_{\text{e},20}B_{\text{T}}R^{2.5}
$$

$$

---------------


### Snipes 1997 ITER Scaling I

Is selected with `i_l_h_threshold = 4` [^3]

- $P_{\text{L-H}}$ is defined as $\left(P_{\text{in}} - \frac{dW}{dt}\right)$

$$
P_{\text{L-H}} = 0.65 \bar{n}_{\text{e},20}^{0.93} B_{\text{T}}^{0.86} R^{2.15}
$$

---------------

###  Snipes 1997 ITER Scaling II

Is selected with `i_l_h_threshold = 5` [^3]

- $P_{\text{L-H}}$ is defined as $\left(P_{\text{in}} - \frac{dW}{dt}\right)$


$$
P_{\text{L-H}} = 0.42 \bar{n}_{\text{e},20}^{0.8} B_{\text{T}}^{0.9} R^{1.99} \kappa^{0.76}
$$

---------------

### Martin 2008 Scalings

The general form is:

$$
P_{\text{L-H}} = 0.0488 e^{\pm0.057} \bar{n}_{\text{e},20}^{0.717 \pm 0.035} B_{\text{T}}^{0.803 \pm 0.032} S_{\text{p}}^{0.941 \pm 0.019}
$$

where $\bar{n}_{\text{e},20}$ is the line-averaged electron density in units of $10^{20} \text{m}^{-3}$, $B_{\text{T}}$ is the toroidal magnetic field in Tesla and $S_{\text{p}}$ is the plasma surface area in $\text{m}^2$.

We apply a mass-correction term to the scaling, stated by Martin et.al [^4] as per:

!!! quote "Mass dependence on threshold"

    "*It is also found in JET that the 
    threshold power in tritium discharges becomes further lower. The dependence of the threshold power 
    on the ion mass number M was roughly given by $P_{\text{L-H}} \propto \frac{1}{M}$ [^9]. When this mass dependence is 
    applied to the deuterium-tritium discharges for ITER, the above predicted values of PThresh can be 
    reduced by ~ 20%.*[^4]"

We thus apply a factor of $\left(\frac{2}{M_{\text{i}}}\right)$ to the end of the scalings, where $M_{\text{i}}$ is the average atomic mass of all ions. Therefore for a pure 50:50 D-T plasma giving a $M_{\text{i}} = 2.5$ the value of $P_{\text{L-H}}$ is dropped by 20%.

### Snipes 2000 Scalings

!!! quote "Excerpt fom Snipes et.al"
    *"A number of regression fits were performed on the full data set of all 10 tokamaks for all
    L–H transition points that fit the standard SELDB2 criteria in deuterium plasmas ($N$ = 702).
    A small improvement in the RMSE was obtained by correcting the total ICRF power from
    Alcator C-Mod with density- and toroidal-field-dependent corrections for the absorbed ICRF
    power based on experimental measurements. For hydrogen minority heating between 5 and
    6 $T$, $P_{\text{abs}} = 0.9\bar{n}_{\text{e}}^{-0.6} P_{\text{ICRH}}$ while for He3 minority heating above 6 T, the assumption is made
    that $P_{\text{abs}} = 0.75 P_{\text{ICRH}}$."*

We apply the same mass-correction factor given in the [Martin 2008 scalings above](#martin-2008-scalings).[^4] [^9] Snipes et.al provides the same justification [^9].

We thus apply a factor of $\left(\frac{2}{M_{\text{i}}}\right)$ to the end of the scalings, where $M_{\text{i}}$ is the average atomic mass of all ions. Therefore for a pure 50:50 D-T plasma giving a $M_{\text{i}} = 2.5$ the value of $P_{\text{L-H}}$ is dropped by 20%.

### Snipes 2000 Closed Divertor Scalings

!!! quote "Excerpt fom Snipes et.al"
    *"Several machines have reported changes in the H-mode threshold due to divertor geometry modifications. ASDEX-Upgrade saw a 15% increase with a more-closed divertor, attributed to higher edge densities. Conversely, JET and JT-60U experienced a 20% decrease after installing more-closed divertors. Alcator C-Mod, with its inherently closed divertor, showed no change in threshold despite further closure of bypass gaps. Preliminary experiments with C-Mod's divertor bypass indicate no threshold change, even with a significant drop in divertor neutral pressure. These variations contribute to the scatter in H-mode threshold regression fits."*

    *"Only four tokamaks have closed-divertor data in the database (Alcator C-Mod, ASDEX-Upgrade, JET, and JT-60U). Although the resulting data set is limited ($N$ = 169)"*

### Martin 2008 Aspect ratio corrected scalings
