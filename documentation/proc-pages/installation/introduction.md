# Introduction

Below are instructions of how to install the applications, code and dependencies such that you
can begin using or developing PROCESS. This includes differing instructions for those working on
different operating systems.

PROCESS is natively supported on Ubuntu 20 and 22, and requires Python 3.8 or greater. Other Linux distributions will be able to successfully
build and execute PROCESS however may give inconsistent results due to version disparities of
dynamically linked libraries; therefore these can't be guaranteed. To install on Ubuntu, Mac, or Windows, please follow the [installation guide](installation-ubuntu.md).
