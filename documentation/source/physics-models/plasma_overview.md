# Plasma physics

!!! warning " Documentation re-write"

    The plasma documentation is slowly going through an update to ensure each section is properly described and up to date. Each section of the plasma now has its own dedicated page

## Introduction

By default, the plasma is assumed to have an up-down asymmetric, single null
configuration (although this can be changed with user inputs). A great number 
of physics models are coded within PROCESS to describe the behaviour of the 
plasma parameters such as its current, temperature, density, pressure, 
confinement etc., and also the various limits that define the stable operating 
domain. 

More detail is given in [^1], but this webpage is more up to date.
