# Process Jupyter notebook examples

Examples of how to use Process are provided in the form of Jupyter notebooks. These provide a convenient way of explaining Process usage alongside runnable code cells, as well as displaying some types of output.

## Running notebooks

### Notebooks in VS Code

The recommended way to run notebooks is in VS Code; this has the additional advantage of being able to debug notebooks. Simply open the `.ipynb` file in VS Code to view and run it. You may be required to select a notebook kernel on first run; be sure to select the virtual environment where PROCESS is installed (e.g. `~/PROCESS/.venv`).

If this is not possible or an error occurs, please consult [our docs](https://ukaea.github.io/PROCESS/usage/examples/).
