  real(dp) :: gamma_he
  !! ratio of specific heats for helium (`primary_pumping=3`)

  ! if cp_he is required place here specific heat capacity at constant pressure: helium (`primary_pumping=3`) [J/(kg.K)]
  ! cp_he is only used in private routine hcll.f90 at the moment

  real(dp) :: t_in_bb
  !! temperature in FW and blanket coolant at blanket entrance (`primary_pumping=3`) [K]

  real(dp) :: t_out_bb
  !! temperature in FW and blanket coolant at blanket exit (`primary_pumping=3`) [K]

  real(dp) :: p_he
  !! pressure in FW and blanket coolant at pump exit (`primary_pumping=3`) [Pa]

  real(dp) :: dp_he
  !! pressure drop in FW and blanket coolant including heat exchanger and pipes (`primary_pumping=3`) [Pa]

  real(dp) :: dp_fw_blkt
  !! pressure drop in FW and blanket coolant including heat exchanger and pipes (`primary_pumping=3`) [Pa]

  real(dp) :: dp_fw
  !! pressure drop in FW coolant including heat exchanger and pipes (`primary_pumping=3`) [Pa]

  real(dp) :: dp_blkt
  !! pressure drop in blanket coolant including heat exchanger and pipes (`primary_pumping=3`) [Pa]

  real(dp) :: dp_liq
  !! pressure drop in liquid metal blanket coolant including heat exchanger and pipes (`primary_pumping=3`) [Pa]

  real(dp) :: htpmw_fw_blkt
  !! mechanical pumping power for FW and blanket including heat exchanger and
  !! pipes (`primary_pumping=3`) [MW]
